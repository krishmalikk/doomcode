DESCRIPTION (max 4,000 characters)
================================================================================

Control your AI coding agent from anywhere with DoomCode.

DoomCode is a mobile-first control system that lets you command AI coding agents running on your desktop - directly from your iPhone. Whether you're stepping away from your desk, commuting, or just prefer the convenience of your phone, DoomCode keeps you connected to your AI assistant.

KEY FEATURES

Mobile Agent Control
Send commands and prompts to your AI coding agent from anywhere. Your agent runs on your desktop while you control it from your phone.

Diff Review & Approval
Review code changes proposed by the AI before they're applied. See exactly what modifications will be made and approve or reject with a single tap. Stay in full control of your codebase.

End-to-End Encryption
All communication between your phone and desktop is encrypted using TweetNaCl. Your code, commands, and data remain private - even we can't read them.

Voice Input
Use speech-to-text for hands-free commands. Perfect for when you're away from your keyboard or want to multitask.

QR Code Pairing
Connect your phone to your desktop in seconds. Just run the CLI command, scan the QR code, and you're paired.

GitHub Integration
Create pull requests directly from your phone. Securely share your GitHub token with your desktop session and manage your repositories on the go.
