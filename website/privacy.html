    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>DoomCode ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application and desktop software.</p>
    <p>By using DoomCode, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
    <p>DoomCode is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> You do not need to create an account or provide any personal information to use DoomCode.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub Token (Optional):</strong> If you choose to use GitHub integration, your GitHub token is shared directly between your mobile device and desktop application via end-to-end encryption. We do not store or have access to your token.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>We may collect limited technical information to ensure the service functions properly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Connection Metadata:</strong> Anonymous session identifiers used to route messages between your mobile device and desktop through our relay servers. These are temporary and deleted when your session ends.</li>
      <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> If the app crashes, we may receive anonymous crash data to help improve stability. This does not include any personal information or code content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The limited information we collect is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Facilitate real-time communication between your mobile device and desktop application</li>
      <li>Improve app stability and performance</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests (if you contact us)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>End-to-End Encryption</h2>
    <p>All communication between your mobile device and desktop is end-to-end encrypted using the TweetNaCl cryptographic library. This means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your code, commands, and messages are encrypted on your device before transmission</li>
      <li>Only your paired devices possess the keys to decrypt the data</li>
      <li>Our relay servers cannot read, access, or store the content of your communications</li>
      <li>Even if our servers were compromised, your data would remain encrypted and unreadable</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On Your Devices:</strong> Session data and preferences are stored locally on your mobile device and desktop. This data is not synced to any cloud service.</li>
      <li><strong>On Our Servers:</strong> We do not store your code, commands, or any content you transmit through DoomCode. Relay servers only temporarily hold encrypted messages in transit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>DoomCode interacts with the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI Agent Providers:</strong> When you use Claude (Anthropic), Codex (OpenAI), or Gemini (Google), your prompts and code are sent to these services according to their respective privacy policies. DoomCode acts as an interface and does not store this data.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> If you enable GitHub integration, you interact with GitHub according to their privacy policy. DoomCode facilitates this connection but does not store your GitHub data.</li>
      <li><strong>AWS (Relay Servers):</strong> We use Amazon Web Services to host our relay servers. AWS processes only encrypted data in transit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or transfer your information to third parties. We may share information only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, regulation, or legal process</li>
      <li><strong>Safety:</strong> To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or others</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Session Data:</strong> Deleted immediately when your session ends</li>
      <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Retained for up to 90 days for debugging purposes</li>
      <li><strong>Support Communications:</strong> Retained as long as necessary to resolve your inquiry</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use DoomCode without providing any personal information</li>
      <li>Delete all local data by uninstalling the app</li>
      <li>Request information about any data we may have about you</li>
      <li>Request deletion of any data associated with you</li>
    </ul>
